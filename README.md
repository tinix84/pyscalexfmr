# PyScaleXFMR - Optimization and Scaling of Medium-Frequency Transformers

## Introduction

This repository contains the **source code** related to the following **paper**:
* **Efficiency / Power Density Analysis of Single-Phase and Three-Phase Transformers Employed in DAB and SRC DC/DC Converters**
* **Thomas Guillod, Daifei Zhang, Charles R. Sullivan, and Johann W. Kolar**
* **IEEE ICRERA 2025**
* [**DOI** (IEEE copyright)](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRERA66237.2025.11283728)
* [**Paper** (IEEE copyright)](paper.pdf)

This code implements simple **medium-frequency transformer models**:
* **Shell-type** and **core-type** transformers.
* **Single-phase** and **three-phase** transformers.
* **Delta** and **wye / star** connected transformers.
* Including the **high-frequency core and winding losses**.
* Including the impact of **non-sinusoidal waveforms**.

This code implements several **optimization methods**:
* Analytical optima for the **number of turns** and the **operating frequency**.
* Numerical optima with a **differential evolution solver**.

This code implements several **scaling laws**:
* **Frequency sensitivity** of transformers
* **Winding material scaling laws**
* **Power / volume scaling laws**
* **DAB / SRC** converter comparison.
* **Single-phase / three-phase** comparison.
